<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    In this tutorial we are going to discuss the construction of the crystallographic point groups.
    The 3 dimensional symmetry exhibited by an object can be described by a set of symmetry operations such a rotations or reflections that
    keep a central point fixed.  These operations combine to fully describe the symmetry of the object or its point group.
    Carrying out the symmetry operations of a point group will result in an identical arrangment of the object described.

    In Crystallography, rather than describe the symmetry of a single object the point group is used to describe the symmetry operations
    exhibited between objects in a crystal.

    There are an infinite number of three dimensional point groups but the restrictions imposed by the requirements of the
    lattice limit these possible point groups to 32 in terms of crystallography.  This means that only 32 groups of symmetry operations
    form repeatable patterns that can be placed on a 3 dimensional lattice.  These point groups can be further seperated into
    both chiral and achiral groups.  Chiral point groups contain only rotational symmetry and we will look at these first.
    Achiralpoint groups can also include mirrors and points of inversion.  In macromolecular crystallography we do not see these
    pointgroups because large molecules cannot be inverted to their mirror forms.  It is however possible to see them in small
    molecule crystals and importantly in the symmetry of diffraction patterns.

    Click on the various sections in the menu to see descriptions of the different point groups observed in crystallography. As you read through
    the sections you will see links that will help to describe both how point groups are constructed and how they are represented
    in crystallography.
