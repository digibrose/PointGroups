    <h1>Point Groups 4.</h1>
    <p>
        When a crystal diffracts X-rays the resulting rays form distinctive patterns on detectors.  As the crystals
        are rotated these patterns change in systematic ways.  Instead of thinking of the crystal rotating we can instead
        think of the detector rotating with the characteristic spots existing as points in space.  The lattice of spots
        that this creates is known as the reciprocal lattice and exhibits symmetry closely related to that of the crystal
        itself.  The difference however is that the diffraction pattern is centrosymetric.  This means that any spot related
        by a rotation of 180&deg; around the central point or origin has the same intensity. Because of this, extra symmetry elements are observed;
        namely mirror planes and inversion centres.
    </p>
    <p>
    A mirror plane reflects an object through the plane whereas a point of inversion transforms objects through the central point inverting the object in the process.
    With an object like a sphere this will have no effect but with chiral objects like
    protein chains this will result in the mirror image of the protein, something that does not exist.  It is for this reason that these
    symmetry elements are not observed in macromolecular crystallography.  However because of the way diffraction occurs the lattice of
    diffracted rays always (nearly always) exhibit a centrosymmtric pattern meaning that the spot indexed  111 has  the same
    intensity as -1-1-1 and 321 the same as -3-2-1.
    This means that alongside the symmetry observed in the crystals we now have these extra symmetries overlayed on the patterns.
    </p>
    <h2>No symmetry</h2>
    <p>
    When there is no symmetry observed in the crystal the resulting diffraction pattern shows only the symmetry resulting from
    the centrosymmetric nature of the diffraction pattern This is represented by a point of inversion through the center of the sphere
    on a stereographic projection. The nomenclature of this symmetry is -1.

    <div id="-1b2" class="pullreturnA">return</div>
</div>
    <h2>Rotational Symmetry</h2>
    <p>
    The diffraction pattern symmetries associated with the simple rotations of even number combine those symmetries with that observed
    in -1 above.  The result of this is to also create a mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. the nomenclature for these
    point groups is 2/m, 4/m and 6/m.

    <div id="2omb2" class="pullreturnA">return</div>
</div>
    <p>
    This is not the case for trigonal symmetry because the inversion center doesn't create a perpendicular mirror. The reulsting point group
    is -3.
    </p>
<div id="-3b" class="pullb">
    Click for example of -3 symmetry</div>
<div id="-3" class="popupA">

    <div id="-3b2" class="pullreturnA">return</div>
</div>

    <h2>Dihedral Symmetry </h2>
    <p>
    Diffraction patterns of crystals exhibiting dihedral symmetry also posses the crystal symmetry alongside that created
    by a point of inversion.  The result of this for patterns with even rotational symmetry is to not only create a
        mirror perpendicular to rotational axis but to also create mirrors parallel to the primary axis.
    </p>

    <div id="mmmb2" class="pullreturnA">return</div>
</div>
    <p>
    Again this is slightly different for trigonal symmetry where the resulting pattern doesn't create the perpendicualr mirror plane
    but the parrallel planes are created.

    <h2>Cubic Symmetry</h2>
    <p>
    The final point groups are the most complicated observed in macromolecular diffraction symmetry.  They are however built up in exactly
    the same manner.  Start with the symmetry elements of the crystallographic point group.  Add a point of inversion and then the other
    symmetry operations appear as a result.  It is worth noting that the symbol for a point of inversion occuring in the center of the sphere
    is repeated on all of the intersecting rotation axes apart from those on the equator.   The nomeclature for these is again somewhat
    less clear with that resulting from diffraction from crsytals with 23 pointgroup having m-3 symmetry and those from 423 having m-3m.
