<h1>
    Point Groups 2.
</h1>
With rotational symmetry we have only been applying one axis of symmetry but molecules and crystals are three dimensional objects.
It is therefore possible to combine rotational symmetries in three dimensions to create more complex relationships.

<h2>
    Dihedral Symmetry
</h2>
<p>
Point Groups that exhibit Dihedral Symmetry contain 1 rotation axis of any of the previously discussed allowed values alongside
2 fold axes perpendicular to the first. There is an important difference in the point group symbols depending on whether the order
of the principal rotation axis is odd or even. In n22, where n=even, there are 2 sets of 2-fold axes, and these sets are not
related by the n-fold symmetry of the principal axis. In n2, where n=odd, there is one set of 2-fold axes and its members are
related by the n-fold symmetry of the principal axis.
</p>
<p>
The point group 222 is the simplest and most commonly found point group symmetry in macromolecular crystallography.  It is simply
built up by combining an initial 2 fold axis with a perpendicular 2 fold axis.  Click on the image below to see how an object can be
reflected through this system in a contained manner creating a finite number of reproduced objects related by the point group symmetry.

<p>
We can now look at both 422 and 622 symmetries and see a very similar pattern emerging The interesting observation here is that as a result
of the perpendicular 2 folds we again create extra elements of symmetry to describe the system.

</div>

<p>
Lastly we will look at 32 symmetry.  As the name implies only 1 axis is created perpendicular to the
    3 fold which is then repeated because of the 3 fold itself.  There are no extra  extra elements of symmetry created.
