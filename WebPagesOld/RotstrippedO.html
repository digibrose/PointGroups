<h2>Rotational Symmetry</h2>
<p>
    The pure rotation axis is probably the simplest symmetry element to comprehend since the eye naturally
    recognises the degree of symmetry that results from it: The higher the order of the rotation axis,
    the more obvious to the eye is the symmetry.
    The definition of a symmetry rotation axis of order n is a line in space about which an object may be
    rotated anticlockwise by 360Â°/n such that its initial and final positions are indistinguishable.
</p>
<p>
    The simplest and commonest example is that of two identical objects, perhaps a dimer of molecules.
Such dimers often have a 2-fold axis and each monomer has an identical environment, with each "side" of the
interface making the same interactions as the other as in the Yin and Yang Chinese symbol, shown below.

    Another commonly observed rotation is the 4 fold.  Rather than the 180&deg rotation observed in the 2 fold now molecules
    are related by a 90&deg; rotation.

<p>
    The last 2 allowed forms of rotational symmetry observed in crystallography are the 3 and 6 fold.  Here molecules are related
    by either 120&deg; rotations or 60&deg; rotations.

    It is hopefully clear how dimeric and tetragonal symmetries can relate to a continuous lattice. It may however not
    be quite as clear how trigonal and hexagonal rotational symmetries do the same.  If you imagine overlaying the
    same symmetry diagram onto the position of the rotated points then we can see how the overlayed patterns extend to
    form a repeatable and familiar pattern.  Click on the images below to see this.

<p>
    So why are these the only possible rotational symmetries observable in crystals?  Why not 5 folds or 8 folds?  It is simply
    because these symmetries do not form a repeatable lattice.  A rotational symetry must move a lattice point to a succession of
    repeatable lattice points.  This means if we look at the vectors between points related by rotational symmetry and transfer
    those vectors to the central point these vectors will point to the same lattice points.  If we try this with other symmetries
    it is not the case. There are more complex proofs of this which we will not go into here.
