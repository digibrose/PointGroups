<h2>
    Stereographic Projections
</h2>
<p>
    In order to make the representation of the different point groups clear there is a system of graphical representation known as
stereographic projections.  This is simply a method of mapping spherical objects onto a plane.  Markers at the edge of the resulting
circle would be positioned on the equator of the sphere and point in the middle at the poles.  Symmetry elements at the edges of the cirlce
therefore represent axes perpendicular to the primary axis which is represented travelling through the poles.  Rather than lines traveling
through the circle these perpendicular axes are represented by symbols on the edge.

Using this method of projection we can now build the final two point groups observed in crystallography which are observed in cubic
spacegroups.  These are 23 and 432.  Alongside the symmetry elements perpendicular to the primary axis we can now see further axes
aty neither pole nor equator.  The elements again form axes travelling through the central point but in intermediate positions rather than
perpendicular to the primary axis.
