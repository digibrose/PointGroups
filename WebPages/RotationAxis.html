<h1>Point Groups 1.</h1>
<p>
In this section we are going to discuss the construction of the crystallographic point groups.
In crystallography, a crystallographic point group is a set of symmetry operations, like rotations or reflections, that
leave a central point fixed.  Carrying out the symmetry operations of a point group will result in an identical arrangment of the
constituent elements.
</p>
<p>
There are an infinite number of three dimensional point groups but the restrictions imposed by the requirements of the
lattice limit these possible point groups to 32 in ersm of crystallography.  This means that only 32 groups of symmetry operations
form repeatable patterns that can be placed on a 3 dimensional lattice.  These point groups can be further seperated into
both chiral and achiral groups.  Chiral point groups contain only rotational symmetry and we will look at these first.
Achiralpoint groups can also include mirrors and points of inversion.  In macromolecular crystallography we do not see these
pointgroups because large molecules cannot be inverted to their mirror forms.  It is however possible to see them in small
molecule crystals and importantly in the symmetry of diffraction patterns.
</p>
<h2>Rotational Symmetry</h2>
<p>
The pure rotation axis is probably the simplest symmetry element to comprehend since the eye naturally
recognises the degree of symmetry that results from it: The higher the order of the rotation axis,
the more obvious to the eye is the symmetry.
The definition of a symmetry rotation axis of order n is a line in space about which an object may be
rotated anticlockwise by 360Â°/n such that its initial and final positions are indistinguishable.
</p>
The simplest and commonest example is that of a dimer of two identical monomers, also called a homodimer.
Such homodimers have a 2-fold axis and each monomer has an identical environment, with each "side" of the
interface making the same interactions as the other as in the Yin and Yang Chinese symbol, shown below.

Another commonly observed rotation is the 4 fold.  Rather than the 180&deg rotation observed in the 2 fold now molecules
are related by a 90&deg; rotation.

<p>
The last 2 allowed forms of rotational symmetry observed in crystallography are the 3 and 6 fold.  Here molecules are related
by either 120&deg; rotations or 60&deg; rotations.

Whereas with 2 folds and 4 folds it may not be quite as clear how these final rotational symmetries can be applied to a
repeatable lattice but if you imagine applying the same symmetry operations at the position of the rotated points (lattice point)
we overlay and extend these points in a repeatable and familiar pattern.  Click on the images below to see this.

<p>
So why are these the only possible rotational symmetries observable in crystals?  Why not 5 folds or 8 folds?  It is simply
because these symmetries do not form a repeatable lattice.  A rotational symetry must move a lattice point to a succession of
repeatable lattice points.  This means if we look at the vectors between points related by rotational symmetry and transfer
those vectors to the central point these vectors will point to the same lattice points.  If we try this with other symmetries
it is not the case. There are more complex proofs of this which we will not go into here.
