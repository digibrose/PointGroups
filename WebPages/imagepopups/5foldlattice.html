    If we try to repeat the process with a five fold lattice then it should be clear that you do not form an overlayed
    lattice. The same applies to every point group other than those with 2,3,4 and 6 fold symmetries.  This is why in crystallography
    we are limited to these symmetries.

    As you can see the repeats do not overlay.  What you actually get is a smaller pentagon created by overlaying the first pattern.
